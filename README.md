## Description and Outcome

This restaurant website was build using webpack. No HTML code was written for this project. Only JS was used to create elements and add them to the DOM. Each page has it's own JS module. 

I learned alot about webpack and what are a module bundler's benefits while making this project. Using and understanding webpack loaders and plugins were a crucial part of this project.   

Build using vanilla JavaScript, webpack and CSS.
